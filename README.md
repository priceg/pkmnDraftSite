Pokemon Team Drafting Site to be used by 2-4 people


The rules my playgroup will be using. Ultimately I will aim for the site to have adjustable rules

We will play with the Doubles OU rules as of (Insert date here)

The battle format will be 2v2 Each player chooses 4 pokemon from their roster. We team preview the 8 pokemon then each player chooses 3 and we battle 6v6. It's best of 3 so you can switch to your alternate between games.

Draft Rules:

>Each pokemon can only be chosen once and the pokemon can only be used by the team that chose it.

>At the start, one team member from each team chooses any legal pokemon to be added to their team's roster

>Then, the other team member chooses any legal pokemon to be added to the draft pool.

>To keep the focus on memes instead of choosing good pokemon, the draft pool will consist of only 40 pokemon along with the 2 chosen pokemon added to the draft pool.

>The 40 pokemon will be as follows:
>>4 randomly chosen OU pokemon
>>6 randomly chosen UU pokemon
>>10 randomly chosen RU pokemon
>>20 randomly chosen PU pokemon

>Each team has 1000 pokedollars to spend on pokemon for their roster

>Each roster must consist of 10 pokemon but can consist of more if the team has residual pokedollars after the draft

>Each team has one wild card they can use at any time during the draft where they pay 50% of the price of a pokemon on their roster to trade it for any legal pokemon in the same tier(even outside the draft pool)

We can discuss the price of each pokemon but I was thinking as a guideline we use these ranges:
OU: 300-400 pokedollars
UU: 250-350 pokedollars
RU: 75-200 pokedollars
PU: 50 pokedollars each
